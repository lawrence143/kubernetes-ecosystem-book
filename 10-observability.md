# Chapter 10 | Observability

Observability (o11y) is all about attaining enhanced understanding and visibility of systems.

A newly found term with various perspectives, it can be seen as a catch-all for what traditionally was monitoring, but evolved and more expansive – rapid analysis of metrics, logs and traces, in a meaningful way, as well as alerting based on the gathered data. For distributed systems such as Kubernetes, it can get quite hard to know what goes wrong at any given moment, given the new complexity of containerization, kubernetes networking layers, multiple containers living randomly in nodes (with some of them having a short lifespan)… Thus, observability is another beast that needs to be tamed for production readiness.
