    # [adriano] In this section we're going to cover the storage options currently available from the ecosystem.
    # There are plenty of storage vendors out there and all are claiming to have a better solution than the others.
    # Moving in this field is like an elephant in a crystals shop: we will hurt someone, unavoidably.
    # To avoid this as much as possible, we'll follow a different approach. 
    # Instead to go with a list of storage vendors/service providers, we can focus on the main storage architectures currently used in kuberentes:
    # - shared storage
    # - container attached storage
    # and the main storage types:
    # - block
    # - file
    # - object
    # and provide examples for each of the above categories, privileging as much as possible the open source solutions.  
    # Feel free to review. Any comment will be appreciated.
    # Thanks.
